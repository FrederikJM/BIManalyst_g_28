# A5: Reflect
# Your learning experience for the concept you focused on
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
I started by being an OpenBIM Modeller with little experience in what was 
possible to do with OpenBIM and Python scripts. I ended up being a confident 
Open BIM Analyst Level 3 and working towards becoming a Self Learner.

I think I need to establish a greater understanding of the data structure of 
IFC and Python programming in general. Even though my ideas and programming 
work in the end I’m positive that there are more efficient ways to perform 
some of the tasks. 

For my future, I will take the knowledge of OpenBIM into my daily work where 
I will challenge the way things normally have been done and create value with
 automation tools. Also, I will use OpenBIM as a tool for my master's thesis.

At the beginning of the semester, I was a BIM Modeler. I had some experience creating BIM Models for my own projects in structural engineering and extracting information by opening and viewing models made by architects. I joined the course to dive deeper into BIM to learn how to extract this information in a faster and more efficient way and make my own custom tools. After 13 weeks, I can confidently say that I have evolved to an Open BIM Analyst who has learnt to apply OpenBIM, although I am still not entirely confident with programming yet.
Improving my shortcomings in programming will allow me to focus on more crucial matters in OpenBIM, like the IFC schemas and how to work with them more effectively or learn how to coordinate large projects. In fact, I hope I will have a chance to work with it in Advanced Building Design next semester.







# Your process of developing the turtorial
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
As I will use OpenBIM in my thesis I think this course has given me an
introduction to a range of tools that I can look into in case my current
toolbox is insufficient to solve a problem.
  
In terms of use cases, I think that it is great with the freedom to choose a
topic that you are passionate about. However, it was challenging coming up
with this specific topic which also fits the scope of the course. 
  
I think the number of tools was sufficient, however, I would have liked more 
hands-on follow-along in-class tutorials, where basic things were presented.
I think many of the lectures presented relevant topics however, I could not
use many of them as answers were some kind of vague or it was hard getting
the tool to even be installed (here I’m thinking of the voxels).

I am not entirely sure of the subject of my thesis yet, but in any case this course helped me understand that implementing BIM would help me to better analyze, evaluate and communicate my project. While working with the tool we developed, I recognized how data exchange can be an issue and how OpenBIM can provide solutions to this.

I think that limiting the choice in use cases would make the course more challenging both because it would probably force everyone to work with something they are not entirely familiar with or like and it would take away the motivation that derives from something that interest them. I would be less motivated to work under a use case I am not interested in although it would make the course more structured and would save time choosing our topic.

Although it is very difficult to work with all these tools over the course of 13 weeks, I think I will have the chance to explore them further earlier. 



# (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial
The key points of the feedback were:

- The visualizations are nice.
- The structure of the tutorial was very clear.
- Elaboration on why 8 is chosen as a scaling factor would be nice.
- Apply help text in the code to help end-user troubleshooting.
- Please make it clearer what the structural engineer should have
     calculated beforehand.
- The length of the different zones can be shown in the plots.





# (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
Yes, I will apply OpenBIM in my thesis where I will look into the 
reconfiguration of concrete elements for new buildings
with Kristoffer Negendahl.

If my boss will invest the resources for me to create automation tools
I would be happy to do so, however, this requires that I continuously upgrade
my skills within this field and that my boss can understand the value this 
can provide. Maybe I should become my own boss?



## Maria Deliveri - s240063

As I mentioned above, I do not know if it will be relevant to my thesis, but I am planning to do so if there is an opportunity to work on it.
However, I hope I will use it in my professional life. I have worked on a large project before and we did have several issues with interoperability. I think that BIM models have proved their value so far, but they have also proved how inefficient and time-consuming they can be when they are not handled correctly. Working with OpenBIM tools would make the workflow more efficient and the data exchange easier. 



# (Individual) Wrap up
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
The journey has been an interesting way of working with OpenBIM. 
I liked the fact that we started investigating and fact-checking in a basic 
manner with A1 before we chose a use case in A2. This was a good way to frame 
the scope of the project regarding the time we had available. Also, I liked 
the way we made a plan of how we were going to solve our problems in A2 before
we started on A3. This made A3 more manageable and it made it possible to 
divide our tool into smaller functions, enabling us to be more efficient.

I see the potential for A4 being a very giving exercise, however, 
my experience was that the presentations of the tutorials were not given 
enough attention by the presenters, which led to me not having the greatest 
takeaways from them. Making A4 seemed to be a task that should just be done 
and ticked off instead of giving value to the peers listening. Also, many 
groups presented their project as a tutorial, which often didn’t add any value 
for me as an Open-BIM user, as the presentations focused more on the overall 
function of the tool than specific ways to solve a specific problem.

I found this course extremely difficult in the beginning but working through the assignments helped me break it down and understand most of the concepts. I have to give credits to my teammate here, who was patiently helping me with programming. The assignments were clearly defined and were structured as steps to understand and achieve the final result.
 In A1, I got to understand how can we access a model and get information without looking at it visually as a 3d model, then in A2 we had the chance to explore use cases and learned our limits regarding to what we can and what we cannot do and this led us to our tool in A3. 
In A3 we broke down the function of our tool to simpler ones and in this way we could understand what parts are working, which ones need to be improved in terms of results' quality and time.
In A4, we could get an insight into what the rest of the teams worked with and learned from their tools. We also got an idea of how we could improve our tool or how we could re-imagine it. However, the presentations in A4 were not always detailed and the fact that we could present any concept we had worked with did not help in making it very clear. I think it would be better if it were mandatory to present the whole tool in this assignment. 
And finishing A5, I got the chance to review what I have learned in this course and evaluate how I can use this knowledge further in my career.
