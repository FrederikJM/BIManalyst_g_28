# A5: Reflect
# Your learning experience for the concept you focused on
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
I started by being an OpenBIM Modeller with little experience in what was 
possible to do with OpenBIM and Python scripts. I ended up being a confident 
Open BIM Analyst Level 3 and working towards becoming a Self Learner.

I think I need to establish a greater understanding of the data structure of 
IFC and Python programming in general. Even though my ideas and programming 
work in the end I’m positive that there are more efficient ways to perform 
some of the tasks. 

For my future, I will take the knowledge of OpenBIM into my daily work where 
I will challenge the way things normally have been done and create value with
 automation tools. Also, I will use OpenBIM as a tool for my master's thesis.

# Your process of developing the turtorial
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
As I will use OpenBIM in my thesis I think this course has given me an
 introduction to a range of tools that I can look into in case my current
  toolbox is insufficient to solve a problem.
  
In terms of use cases, I think that it is great with the freedom to choose a
 topic that you are passionate about. However, it was challenging coming up
  with this specific topic which also fits the scope of the course. 
  
I think the number of tools was sufficient, however, I would have liked more 
hands-on follow-along in-class tutorials, where basic things were presented.
 I think many of the lectures presented relevant topics however, I could not
  use many of them as answers were some kind of vague or it was hard getting
   the tool to even be installed (here I’m thinking of the voxels).
