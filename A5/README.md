# A5: Reflect
# Your learning experience for the concept you focused on
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
I started by being an OpenBIM Modeller with little experience in what was 
possible to do with OpenBIM and Python scripts. I ended up being a confident 
Open BIM Analyst Level 3 and working towards becoming a Self Learner.

I think I need to establish a greater understanding of the data structure of 
IFC and Python programming in general. Even though my ideas and programming 
work in the end I’m positive that there are more efficient ways to perform 
some of the tasks. 

For my future, I will take the knowledge of OpenBIM into my daily work where 
I will challenge the way things normally have been done and create value with
 automation tools. Also, I will use OpenBIM as a tool for my master's thesis.

At the beginning of the semester I was a BIM Modeller. I had some experience creating BIM Models for my own projects in structural engineering and extracting information by opening and viewing models made by architects. I joined the course to dive deeper into BIM to learn how to extract these information in a faster and more efficient way, and make my own custom tools. After 13 weeks, I can confidently say that I have evolved to an Open BIM Analyst although I am still not entirely confident with programming.







# Your process of developing the turtorial
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
As I will use OpenBIM in my thesis I think this course has given me an
introduction to a range of tools that I can look into in case my current
toolbox is insufficient to solve a problem.
  
In terms of use cases, I think that it is great with the freedom to choose a
topic that you are passionate about. However, it was challenging coming up
with this specific topic which also fits the scope of the course. 
  
I think the number of tools was sufficient, however, I would have liked more 
hands-on follow-along in-class tutorials, where basic things were presented.
I think many of the lectures presented relevant topics however, I could not
use many of them as answers were some kind of vague or it was hard getting
the tool to even be installed (here I’m thinking of the voxels).

# (As a group) summary of the feedback you recieved on your tutorial




# (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
Yes, I will apply OpenBIM in my thesis where I will look into the 
reconfiguration of concrete elements for new buildings
with Kristoffer Negendahl.

If my boss will invest the resources for me to create automation tools
I would be happy to do so, however, this requires that I continuously upgrade
my skills within this field and that my boss can understand the value this 
can provide. Maybe I should become my own boss?

# (Individual) Wrap up
## Frederik Jønsson Madsen - s183666
The journey has been an interesting way of working with OpenBIM. 
I liked the fact that we started investigating and fact-checking in a basic 
manner with A1 before we chose a use case in A2. This was a good way to frame 
the scope of the project regarding the time we had available. Also, I liked 
the way we made a plan of how we were going to solve our problems in A2 before
we started on A3. This made A3 more manageable and it made it possible to 
divide our tool into smaller functions, enabling us to be more efficient.

I see the potential for A4 being a very giving exercise, however, 
my experience was that the presentations of the tutorials were not given 
enough attention by the presenters, which led to me not having the greatest 
takeaways from them. Making A4 seemed to be a task that should just be done 
and ticked off instead of giving value to the peers listening. Also, many 
groups presented their project as a tutorial, which often didn’t add any value 
for me as an Open-BIM user, as the presentations focused more on the overall 
function of the tool than specific ways to solve a specific problem.
